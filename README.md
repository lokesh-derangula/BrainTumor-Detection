# BrainTumor- Detection of Brain Tumor of a MRI Image by using Combination of CNN Mobilenet and LSTM This project aims to develop a robust and accurate system for the detection of brain tumors from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with MobileNet architecture and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we seek to enhance the precision and efficiency of tumor detection in medical imaging.

Key Features:

CNN (MobileNet): The MobileNet architecture is chosen for its lightweight design, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices without compromising on performance. CNNs are utilized to extract meaningful features from the MRI images, enabling precise localization and classification of tumors.

LSTM Integration: LSTM networks are employed to capture temporal dependencies within sequential MRI scans. By analyzing the evolution of tumor characteristics across multiple time steps, the LSTM component enhances the model's ability to discern subtle changes indicative of tumor growth or regression.

Data Preprocessing: Rigorous preprocessing techniques are applied to MRI images to enhance contrast, remove noise, and standardize imaging parameters. This ensures consistency and reliability in tumor detection across diverse datasets.

Model Training and Evaluation: The CNN (MobileNet) and LSTM models are trained on annotated MRI datasets comprising both tumor and non-tumor samples. Training is conducted with a focus on optimizing model performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Rigorous evaluation protocols, including cross-validation and testing on unseen data, validate the robustness of the proposed approach.

Deployment and Accessibility: The trained models are made accessible through user-friendly interfaces, enabling healthcare professionals to seamlessly integrate tumor detection into their diagnostic workflows. Additionally, the codebase is documented extensively to facilitate ease of understanding, modification, and further research contributions.

Applications:

Early detection and monitoring of brain tumors in clinical settings. Support for radiologists and healthcare practitioners in interpreting MRI scans. Integration with medical imaging software for automated tumor detection and analysis. Contributions:

Contributions to this project, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and performance optimizations, are welcome from the open-source community. Together, we can advance the state-of-the-art in medical imaging and contribute to improving healthcare outcomes for patients worldwide.
